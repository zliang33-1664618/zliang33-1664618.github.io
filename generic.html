							<p>With so many amazing destinations to choose from, and so much information on the Internet, narrowing down your ideal destinations can seem daunting (whether it’s your first time, or a return visit).

									The good news is that Japan has so many incredible places to visit (and bucket list-worthy Japan experiences), that you basically can’t go wrong.
									
									The “bad” news (if there is any) is that there’s no such thing as a true “best places in Japan” list, since so much comes down to personal preferences and interests.
									
									But to help you navigate the possibilities and decide where to visit, we’ve put together our very own guide to Japan’s best destinations.
									
									</p>

							<p>One of the key factors in how many places you will be able to visit during your trip is of course how much time you have available (not to mention your ideal travel pace).

									People often ask us, “How many days should I spend in Japan?” There is no simple answer to this, but my usual answer is that you should spend as long as possible!
									
									Generally speaking, the more time you can devote to your trip, the better. Apart from the fact that there is so much to see and do, it’s also worth devoting extra time (if you can) as it’s a relatively long journey for travelers from far-off parts of the world like the US, Europe, and Australia.</p>

							<p>7-10 DAYS IN JAPAN : 
									Typically, the minimum we recommend is about 7-10 days in Japan. 7-10 days gives you a great starting point, and plenty of time for at least an introduction to the country.
									
									Our 8-day sample trip featuring Tokyo, Kyoto, and Hakone is a great example of how much you can see and do with this amount of time.</p>

							<p>10-14 DAYS IN JAPAN : 
									With 10-14 days in Japan, you can of course add on additional destinations, or even simply spend more time immersing yourself in each place you visit.	
									</p>

							<p>3 WEEKS IN JAPAN :
									While less common among our travelers from places like the US, many of our Australian clients are fortunate enough to be able to devote 3 or more weeks to traveling around Japan.
									
									With around 3 weeks in Japan (or more) you have time for a relatively comprehensive itinerary, including a variety of regions and a significant degree of immersion.
									
									With this much time the possible itinerary permutations are almost limitless, so we hope our list of destinations below helps you narrow things down to your own personal wish list!</p>
